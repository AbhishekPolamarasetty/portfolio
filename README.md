This repository is a collection of web technologies commonly used for building modern websites. 
It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code examples, as well as a single combined README file to provide an overview of these technologies.

## HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. 
It defines the structure and layout of a webpage's content. HTML uses a tag-based syntax to create elements that form the basis of a web document.

Here's a simple HTML template example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a sample paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we have a basic HTML document with a title, a heading, and a paragraph.

## CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a web page written in HTML. 
It defines how elements should be displayed, including layout, colors, and fonts.

Here's a sample CSS code for styling a webpage:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
}

p {
  color: #666;
}
```

In this example, we set the font family and background color for the entire page, as well as define the text color for heading and paragraph elements.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for enhancing the interactivity and functionality of web pages. 
It can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS, handle user interactions, and make web applications dynamic.

Here's a simple JavaScript code that displays an alert when a button is clicked:

```javascript
// Get the button element by its ID
const myButton = document.getElementById('myButton');

// Add a click event listener to the button
myButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
});
```

In this example, we use JavaScript to select a button element by its ID and add a click event listener to it. When the button is clicked, an alert is shown.

This repository combines the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create beautiful and interactive web pages. T
hese technologies are the backbone of web development and provide endless possibilities for building modern and responsive websites. Feel free to explore the code examples and expand your knowledge of web development.
